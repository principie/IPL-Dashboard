## Problem Statement

- Find the Title Winner, Orange Cap Winner, Purple Cap Winner, Tournamnet 6's and 4's for the respective season on IPL.
- Develope IPL Batting and Bowling stats and add a filter where user can select the bowler and batter to see these stats.

- Matches win by venue.
- Total wins by team in a season.
- Matches won based on the result type.


### STAKEHOLDERS
- BCCI
- Franchise/ Team Owners
- Team management
- Coaches
- Players
- Media 
- Public

### FUNCTIONALITIES
- Data modeling with three tables
- Data cleaning in Power Query
- Time Intelligence function 
- Creating KPI's 
- Dax Queries
- Creating and formating charts
- Different DAX functions like Calculate,Sum,Sumx,Filter,Allselected,
  values,selectedvalue,return,concatenate,diving etc
- Creating different shapes and formating
- Generating insights from charts
- Export report

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : **Data Processing** -> Create Calender Table 
           
            Calender Table = CALENDAR(MIN(ipl_matches_2008_2022[match_date]),MAX(ipl_matches_2008_2022[match_date]))

- Step 3 : For extract the year from this date table created new column (Year)

            Year = YEAR('Calender Table'[Date])
   This particular table will be used as a filter which will be representing a season.
- Step 4 : **Data modeling** -> Create a relationship between those tables and create a column named Date.

        You can see a relationship has been created over here which represents one to many.
- Step 5 :  Then select Slicer for season and place the `Calender[Year]` table into the field section and change the slicer style into dropdown. 
- Step 6 : Write a DAX funtion to determine the select season or Title Winner. Created a new measure in 'ipl_matches_2008_2022' table. To find the title winner we have to find max date. **In every season the last match played was final match and who won that particular match was title winner.**

           
           Title Winnner = VAR max_date = CALCULATE(MAX('Calender Table'[Date]),ALLSELECTED(ipl_matches_2008_2022), VALUES(ipl_matches_2008_2022))
           var title_winner = CALCULATE(SELECTEDVALUE(ipl_matches_2008_2022[winning_team]), 'Calender Table'[Date] = max_date)
           return title_winner
  A card visual was used to represent the **Title Winner**.

- Step 7 : Select a card and choose 'ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022' table, then drag the 'batter' into filter section and **choose top N**, then take sum of batter-run and put it into by values. Then select another card and **choose sum of batsman-run to get total runs he made**. To join two particular fields used `CONCATENATE` function. And it also represents the **Orange Cap Winner**. Same for the **Purple Cup Winner** choose 'is_wicke_delivery' but here we have to aslo choose 'dismisal_kind' bcz some out (runout,retired hurt etc) not given to that particular bowler.  
           
           Batter Runs = CONCATENATE(SUM(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[batsman_run]), " Runs")
           Bowler Wickets = CONCATENATE(SUM(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[iswicket_delivery]), " Wickets")

- Step 8 : For the 6's & 4's choose `âˆ‘ batsman-run`and in basic filtering section choose only 6 and same for 4's.

- Step 9 : Create a slicer and choose 'batter' and it will affecting the other visuals.So edited the interaction of this particular filter.Then create a card ti count total runs of that particular batsman then choose 6's and 4's respectively. Same for bowling stats.
         
         Strike Rate for Batsman = (SUM(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[batsman_run])/COUNT(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[ball_number])) * 100

  To find the Economy create a card and a new measure
              
           Economy = DIVIDE(
                SUMX(
                FILTER(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022,ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[extra_type]<>"legbyes" && ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[extra_type]<>"byes"),ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[total_run]),(COUNT(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[overs]))/6)     

  To find the avergae create a measure

           Average by Bowler = DIVIDE(
                SUMX(
                FILTER(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022, ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[extra_type]<>"legbyes" && ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[extra_type]<>"byes"),ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[total_run]),SUM(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[iswicket_delivery])) 

   For Bowling Strike Rate 

         Bowling SR = COUNT(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[bowler])/SUM(ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022[iswicket_delivery])

- Step 10 : Create a Donut Chart for matches win based on toss decision and create a measure for that.

          Matches won on toss decision = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(ipl_matches_2008_2022), ipl_matches_2008_2022[toss_winner] =ipl_matches_2008_2022[winning_team])
